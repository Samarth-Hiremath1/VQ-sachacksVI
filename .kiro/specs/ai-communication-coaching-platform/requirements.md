# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive AI-driven communication coaching platform. The platform will leverage advanced machine learning technologies including speech recognition (Web Speech API), pose detection (Google MediaPipe), and natural language processing to provide real-time feedback and personalized coaching for presentation skills. The system will use a hybrid ML approach with PyTorch for body language classification and TensorFlow for speech analysis, integrated with MLflow for experiment tracking. The platform will simulate AWS S3 and Cloud Run for scalable deployment, with Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring, all orchestrated through Airflow DAGs and containerized with Docker.
